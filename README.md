# Lifebloom Glow

TL;DR This addon puts a glow around lifebloom's icon when it is in the pandemic window.

At 30% of an initial duration of a dot/hot you are able to recast that ability without losing any damage or healing from that ability.

While the same holds true for lifebloom, there is a secondary effect that happens when you refresh it in this 30% window: The "bloom" that normally only happens when you let it expire or it gets dispelled gets triggered.

It is because of this that it is very important to only refresh lifebloom in this important window.

This addon was meant to eliminate the guesswork involved with knowing when to refresh Lifebloom by putting a glow border (the same border that is used for dispellable debuffs) around lifebloom when it is in the correct window of time to be bloomed.

This addon is lightweight, and intended to only be functional with the default blizzard frames.
